###Make it easier to bring sunlight to Missouri's state and local governments  
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT  
  
While there are already resources out there for automated FOIA requests, like [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/), we want to make it easier to automate this process for reaching the MIsosuri legislation and multiple local governments at once.  
  
* Hashtags and Tags: ?
* Partners: OpenDataSTL and Better Together STL
* Additional Points of Contact: TBD  
  
##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION  
  
Part of this challenge is a compilation of information. We need a way to compile and update local government entities and state agencies, and to keep a current list of the custodians of records for those groups. The next step is automating the sunshine request process, from sending the request, to message tracking, to timing response times, as well as notifying the attorney general that a request was sent.  
Much of this could be handled by the [MuckRock API](https://github.com/MuckRock/API-examples), but not all of it, and a MuckRock based application specific to Missouri would make the request process easier and more accessible to residents who might not otherwise make a request.
