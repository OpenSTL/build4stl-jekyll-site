[Avian Infographics Challenge](http://hackforchange.org/challenges/avian-infographics/)  
  
# Show and share migratory bird survey data to increase public awareness and promote support for wildlife conservation and management.  Create templates for dynamic graphics and maps using agency data.

## BACKGROUND

Our goal is to connect with the conservation-minded public to increase their understanding of how we, the USFWS, use our data to make wildlife management decisions. The USFWS collects annual data about waterfowl populations across a large portion of the continent in order to set hunting regulations, and manage and conserve habitat. Currently, we make the survey data available in static tables, but data in this format are not easily accessible to conservation-minded citizens, including bird watchers, waterfowl hunters, and many of our biologist partners.

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Connect people with the science of conservation and wildlife management using innovative and informative graphics that demonstrate how waterfowl distributions change with changing landscape conditions. Integrate our data with environmental data collected by other government agencies

## Data & Other Resources

Waterfowl breeding population and habitat survey data: 74 932 Records 1955-current (stratum by year estimates); https://migbirdapps.fws.gov
Precipitation data: National weather service/Canadian weather service
  
##  NEXT STEPS

Challenge applications will be integrated onto two existing websites: http://www.flyways.us and on the Division of Migratory bird management’s website within http://www.fws.gov and used to develop additional visualizations.
