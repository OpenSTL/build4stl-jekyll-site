###Can you create an application leveraging the U.S. Census Bureau’s City SDK that addresses an integrated sustainability problem in your city? Integrated sustainability problems may include a mix of economic, environmental, social, cultural, and housing themes.
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT  
  
Whether we live in a small or large city there are lots of changes taking place across economic, environmental, social, cultural, and housing factors in our neighborhoods, counties, and cities. Are our cities evolving towards a higher quality of life for all? Are our cities progresses sustainable? How can we use open data to explore these changes and unlock opportunities improve our cities?

The Census Bureau has developed an open data software development kit (SDK) to enable a community, public, or private sector individuals and organizations to more easily extract value from Census data through user-friendly Application Program Interfaces (APIs). Through the SDK we are aiming to provide a user friendly “Toolbox” for civic hackers to connect local and national public data in order to bring forth innovative solutions for our communities.

##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION  
  
The U.S. Census Bureau is calling all urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, community organizers, and anyone with the passion to make their city better to develop solutions (web, mobile applications and tools) using the City SDK platform.

We encourage you to apply multiple open datasets to explore your city’s most pressing sustainability issues across economic, environmental, social, cultural, and housing factors.

Examples of integrated sustainability problems could be:

* How can I help my community find green spaces for outdoor activities via Google, Bing maps?
* How do I help my community better understand the impact of commercial economic development on affordable housing?
* How can I help my community identify local sustainable job opportunities
