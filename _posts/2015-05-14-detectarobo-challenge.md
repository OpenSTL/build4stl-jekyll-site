###Help the FTC defeat robocalls!
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT

##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION  
  
Contestants will analyze data from an existing robocall honeypot and create algorithms that identify the calls that are robocalls. Contestants will receive two datasets of call detail records. The first is a training set that Contestants will use to develop their algorithms. Contestants will apply their algorithms to the second dataset and identify which calls in the dataset are robocalls. Additional information about the data and the contest rules are available on the contest website at www.ftc.gov/detectarobo.  
  
##NEXT STEPS  
  
The FTC will announce the winners on the contest website after the judges have reviewed the submissions. The FTC also intends to make the winning solution available to the public.
