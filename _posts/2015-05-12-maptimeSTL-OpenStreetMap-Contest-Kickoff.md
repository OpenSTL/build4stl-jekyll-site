Join us at the [May 12th maptimeSTL meetup](http://www.meetup.com/maptimeSTL/events/222435942/) to learn about [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and kick off two friendly mapping competitions - complete with mappy trophies and bragging rights for an entire year!

Can't make it to maptimeSTL in person? No problem! You can still take part in the competitions - and you can follow [@maptimeSTL](https://twitter.com/maptimestl) on twitter for updates and tips for beginner mappers. 

### 1. Greatest Number of Edits

We'll be awarding a trophy at the Build for STL hackathon to the person who makes the greatest number of edits to OSM between May 12th at 6:30pm (maptimeSTL meetup time!) and midnight on May 30th. 

In order for your edits to count, please include #Build4STL and/or #maptimeSTL in your commit message when you save them.

### 2. Best #OSMSelfie

If quantity of edits isn't your thing, we'll also be awarding a trophy to the person with the best #OSMSelfie. An [#OSMSelfie](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Be%20A%20Mapper/diary/26355) is a photo of you next to something you added to or changed in OSM and a link to the OSM edit you made. Map something interesting, take a photo, and bragging rights could be yours!

For your #OSMSelfie to count, you'll have to do two things: first, include #Build4STL and/or #maptimeSTL in your commit message when you save your edit. Then, share your photo and the link to your edit with maptimeSTL via [twitter](https://twitter.com/maptimestl) or our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/maptimeSTL/). Share as many #OSMSelfies as you want starting May 12th at 6:30 and ending at midnight on May 30th - and contribute early and often!
