###Data to a scientist is like water to a swimmer. They can’t get very far without it.  
  
###Help scientists, engineers, professors, students and other technical experts quickly find and download the data they need to advance knowledge and develop new products.  
  
###The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides online access to high quality scientific data in a wide range of disciplines. This app challenge improves access and usability for four heavily used NIST datasets.  
  
##BACKGROUND  
  
Forensic investigators, biochemical engineers, environmental researchers, and many other technically trained experts routinely use NIST Standard Reference Data to identify trace chemicals and to design new experiments and products such as pharmaceuticals. Students from high school through graduate school use the same datasets to master the ropes of scientific discovery.  
  
With over 100 types of data available, however, finding exactly what you need quickly and easily can be challenging. NIST invites the civic hackathon community to develop innovative apps that aggregate and improve the usability of free NIST datasets and resources. There are no existing mobile or tablet applications designed for NIST scientific reference datasets. Help us put the power of data at experts’ fingertips even when they are in the lab or out in the field.

##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION  
  
Scientists need data—from the atomic weight of carbon and the structure of benzene, to the most precise value for the speed of light. High quality physical and chemical reference data helps researchers design experiments, build better products, solve health and environmental problems, and even study the stars. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, provides some of the most accurate and comprehensive datasets in the world. Help NIST improve access to this critical information by creating new apps so that researchers can quickly find what they need, starting with the four Scientific Reference Data identified in the challenge description. Everyone from Nobel-prize-winning physicists to high school chemistry students will thank you!  
  
##Data & Other Resources
For this challenge, NIST has identified four initial datasets pertaining to physics and chemistry data:  

1. CODATA Fundamental Physical Constants: The fundamental physical constants have specific and universally-used symbols, including the velocity of light in vacuum (c), charge of the electron (e), and Planck’s constant (h). These constants are essential to basic theories of physics and our quantitative understanding of the physical universe. This resource provides the most accurate internationally recommended values of these constants available. (NIST SRD 121)

2. Ground Levels and Ionization Energies for the Neutral Atoms: This resource provides scientific values of ground levels and ionization energies for neutral atoms. (NIST SRD 111) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-ground-levels-and-ionization-energies-for-the-neutral-atoms-srd-111  
3. Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions: This compilation of data provides atomic weights for elements 1 through 118, noting isotopic compositions or abundances when appropriate. (NIST SRD 144) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-srd-144  
4. NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database (CCCBDB): The CCCBDB provides thermochemical data for a selected set of over 1,000 gas-phase atoms and molecules. It is used by chemists to compare experimental results with computational ideal-gas properties. (NIST SRD 101) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-computational-chemistry-comparison-and-benchmark-database-srd-101  
Other: additional Free Online NIST Standard Reference Data can be found by searching the NIST Data Gateway http://srdata.nist.gov/gateway  
  
##NEXT STEPS

NIST intends to hold an App Developer public prize competition later this summer (details TBD). We are also continually expanding the publically available data files for our Standard Reference Data.
