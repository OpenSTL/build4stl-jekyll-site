###New to mapping? Use National Day of Civic Hacking to learn about OpenStreetMap–the most complete open data map of the world.
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT  
  
National Day of Civic Hacking is the perfect time for you and others interested in mapping to learn the foundations of [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), the map that anyone can edit.

By following [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/), the step-by-step guide to contributing and using OpenStreetMap, you can empower your community to start being an active contributor to how we get places on the map. We recommend going through the [Beginner’s Guide](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/) where you will learn two of the Open Street Map editing frameworks–iD Editor and JOSM–as well as field guides such as Field Papers.
