###Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to employ interactive maps, interactive timelines or a visually appealing set of infographics. The dataset contains data over time as well as data across states making both visualization of a timeline to show progress over time or across states to show the disparity in protection from secondhand smoke across regions possible.
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT  
  
Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Each year, approximately 480,000 Americans die from tobacco-related illnesses. Further, 5.6 million children alive today will ultimately die early from smoking if current rates continue. For every person who dies from tobacco use, 30 more people suffer with serious tobacco-related illness. More than 16 million Americans suffer with at least one disease caused by smoking.

##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION  
  
Within the Tobacco Use Data health area there are more than thirty datasets that present data from varied topic areas including: tobacco use prevalence for both adults and youth, second hand smoke exposure estimates in the workplace and home, state laws on cigarette tax, smokefree indoor air, youth access and many other areas. CDC seeks to employ interactive maps, interactive timelines or a visually appealing set of infographics. The dataset contains data over time as well as data across states making both visualization of a timeline to show progress over time or across states to show the disparity in protection from secondhand smoke across regions possible.

Examples of Visualizations:

* Interactive US map that shows data for states annually over time
* Interactive timeline that shows states adoption of smokefree laws in key venues annually over time
* Interactive infographic that shows key data for each state in a visually appealing format (eg shape of the state)  
  
##DATA & OTHER RESOURCES  
  
* Chronic Disease and Health Promotion Data and Indicators Tobacco Use Data Portal
* CDC STATE System Tobacco Legislation – Smokefree Indoor Air Dataset – 1995-2015. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. Legislation – Smokefree Indoor Air. The STATE System houses current and historical state-level legislative data on tobacco use prevention and control policies. Data are reported on a quarterly basis. Data include information related to state legislation on smokefree indoor air in several types of establishments.
