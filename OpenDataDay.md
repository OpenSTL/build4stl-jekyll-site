            * Pattern & relationship discovery - End product demonstrates discovery of pattern and/or relationship in the dataset
            * Critical thinking - End product dives deeper into the dataset (e.g. investigate outliers), author(s) considered the dataset from multiple perspectives.
            * Technique - End product makes use of statistical methods. The use of advanced statistical methods is a plus.
            * Statistical rigor - Author(s) understands assumptions made about dataset and/or statistical methods. Appropriate statistical methods are applied for the problem.
        2. Story Telling
            * Meaningfulness to target audience - End product identified a target audience. Presentation is considered from target audiences' point of view.

            * Readability - End product is not cluttered, and conveys information in a clear manner. 
            * Annotation - End product contains meaningful annotation to provide context to help the audience understand the data.
            * Aesthetics - End product has visual appeal.
