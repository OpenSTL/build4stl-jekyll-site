The "Make St. Louis Better" Hackathon will take place May 29th-31st, 2015 at Unisys AMCOE in the [555 Building](/555-building/).  

The Hackathon is a creation sprint, in which teams will spend 48 hours building something that will make St. Louis a better place. The result can be software, applications, devices, art–anything that benefits the community. (The volunteer fair immediately preceding the Hackthon may help spark ideas!) Datasets and APIs will be available, and mentors will be on hand to help teams tackle their projects. Food and drink will be provided for the participants.

This year, our Build4STL Hackthon will not be a competition with prizes. We'll still have project pitches, teams formation, and team presentations - but the focus will be on providing space, data, mentors, and resources to help all teams build their best possible tools for St. Louis! We're also asking teams to open source the code they build over the weekend so that everyone can benefit. (Although we still encourage teams who want to create startups around their hackathon projects to continue after Build4STL in whatever way works best for them!)
